Study project on [_The Complete JavaScript Course 2022_](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-javascript-course/) by [_Jonas Schmedtmann_](https://www.udemy.com/user/jonasschmedtmann/).

## Descriprion

A game for two players. In order to win a player need to reach 100 points. Rolling the dice gives a random number between 1 and 6. But if 1 is rolled the turn passes to another player.

## How it was made

_HTML_ and _CSS_ code was written by the teacher. I wrote _JavaScript_ code along with video explanations.
